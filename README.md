# IMPORTANT Disclaimer For Evaluator
Since you are didn't provide any correct examples for winning turtle. Since you have a lot of mistakes in your instruction, some of which contradict to each other. Since you are didn't proive the correct edge coordinate for the board:
*BOARD STARTS WITH (1:1) coordinate, not with (0:0)*
Please don't count it as a mistake since I am fully understand what it could be. This is could be the missunderstanding, but not the mistake! Thank you for you attention!   _Enjoy!_
